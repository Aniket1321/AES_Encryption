# AES_Encryption

In today's digital age, the need for secure communication and data protection has never been greater. The concept of encryption plays a pivotal role in ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of our digital assets.

The Advanced Encryption Standard more commonly known as AES is a fundamental pillar of modern cryptography, stands as a powerful technique that allows two parties to communicate securely by using a shared secret key for both encryption and decryption.
Developed as a replacement for its predecessor, DES (Data Encryption Standard), AES has become the go-to choice for securing data across a multitude of applications, from online banking to confidential government communications.

This project embarks on an exploration of AES encryption, its strengths against modern cryptographic attacks, and its adaptability in the face of evolving security challenges.
